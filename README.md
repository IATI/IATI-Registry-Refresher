# IATI Registry Refresher
This small aplication allows you to query the CKAN implementation at iatiregistry.org
to find all 'end point' urls of data recorded on the registry, and to then download that data.

The registry holds records about where data can be found on the interent.

The application is basically 2 scripts that you run one after the other.

`grab_urls.php` 
queries the registry and creates a text file for each group on the registry of all url end points of IATI data files

`fetch_data.sh`
uses wget to pull all the data from those url text files and deposit them in their own directory.

Installation and usage
----------------------

Place all files in the same directory.
Create an empty directory called 'urls'

Run fetch_data.sh to get all the data.
